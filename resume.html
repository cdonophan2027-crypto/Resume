<h2>About me</h2>
  
<p>Welcome to my Resume! My name is Cooper Donophan. I enjoy outside work, coding, and editing pictures. When I get home the first thing I do is listen to some music. I personally fancy older music, but I don't judge.</p>
<p>I can make games, websites, I can edit photos or videos if/whenever you may need it.</p>
<p>I have work experience in Lawn Care, Tool Maintenance, and Supply Management for <strong>Cutting Edge W.V.</strong>.</p>
